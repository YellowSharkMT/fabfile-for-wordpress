[ placeholder - information on extending FFWP ]

Fabfile for Wordpress is designed to allow you to override the core classes, and thus extend/customize the way it behaves. The package includes example file(s) for you to start from, you must rename them and remove the "`_example`" stem from the filename. So for example, the `release_example.py` file must be renamed to `release.py`.

- Early stages of the project here, more documentation will be added!
